		<h1>Player Class</h1>
		The player class represents a player of a match.
		That includes pers name, which is set from the user
		playing Akuga, the phase of the game the player is in.
		A player can be in the pick_phase where per is only allowed
		to pick a jumon from the pick pool, the summon_phase where per
		is only allowed to summon one of the jumons per has picked,
		and the move_phase where a player is allowed to move on of
		pers summoned jumons per turn.
		The player class also stores if a player is dead or has won,
		the jumons per has picked and the jumon per has summoned.

		<h1>Neutral Player</h1>
		The neutral player is a trick to implement neutral jumons.
		The neutral player summones picks neutral jumon from the
		pick pool and summones them before the game starts.
		If its the neutral players turn one of the neutral jumons is
		selected randomly and its 'do_a_move' function is invoked.
		This 'do_a_move' function has to result in a state change to
		the check move state to do the move of the selected jumon.
