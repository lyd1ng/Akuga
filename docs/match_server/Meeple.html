		<h1>Jumon</h1>
		The jumon class represent the kind of meeple which can be controlled
		by a player. A jumon has an attack and defense value which is used
		for attacking or defending an arena tile, a color which is used
		to determine the bonus the jumon get from the arena tile he occupies,
		a movement which allows a jumon to move, a unique name to identify
		the jumon, a position on which arena tile the jumon stands and
		persistent as well as nonpersistent interferences.
		These interferences are used implement special abilities of jumons
		altering characteristics of other jumons.
		Both kinds of interferences are a dictionary storing an attack and defense
		value as a tupel under the name of the interference as the key.
		Nonpersistent interferences are reset and set every turn, they can
		be used to implement special abilities which depends on the position
		of jumons, while persistent interferences arent reset and stay even
		if the interfering jumon dies.
		Jumons can have special abilities as well as a special move.
		The special ability is implemented in a function 'special_ability'
		and gets the current state of the state machiene and the scheduled
		state change (the next state and its state variables) as parameters.
		Now depending on the current state different abilities can trigger
		and alter the state variables or even the next state the state
		machiene jumps to.
		The special move of a jumon is implemented in two functions.
		First, the 'is_special_move_legal' function is invoked in the
		check_special_move state of the state machiene and determines
		if the selected target is a valid target for the special move.
		If the move is legal the 'do_special_move' function is invoked
		which works exactly like the 'special_ability' function.
		Jumons can equipt artefacts which can alter the characteristics
		of a jumon or add a special ability or a special move.
		The special_ability functions of artefacts are invoked after
		at the end of the special_ability function and can overwrite the
		special ability of the jumon. The same is true for special moves.

		<h1>Artefact</h1>
		The artefact class represents an artefact within the game.
		Artefacts can be equipped by jumons and alter their characteristics
		or add special abilities. Altering the equipped jumon can
		happen in multiple ways, as a passive special ability invoked within
		the idle state of the state machiene, or during the attach_to and
		detach_from function.

		<h1>Neutral Jumon</h1>
		A neutral jumons isnt a class on its own, its just a jumon with
		a special ability of a certain kind.
		Neutral Jumons are controlled by the neutral player, and are selected
		randomly during its turn. The special ability of neutral jumons
		has to trigger in the idle state and result in a state change to 
		the check_move state. This way a neutral jumons moves itself
		and ends the turn of the neutral player.
