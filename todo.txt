100.	Expand User Class
101.	Propagate inter turn messages like 'summon_msg, move_msg'.
	This is used to render actions life.
200.	Add the possibility to enqueue post turn state changes.
  	Those could be used to implemenet mass displacements,
  	which isn`t possible, yet.
300.	Make the rule building state machine independent of the
  	current player. By adding a secret id to all events, which
	specifies the user per has send the event. That makes it
	neccessary to send the secred id to the clients which will
	send them in every command to identify them at the server.
	The secrets if the players should be public within the
	server architecture so jumons can use them in their special
	ability to send events to the rule building fsm in the name
	of an opponent player. E.g: displacement, summoning.
400.	Use non blocking sockets within the match server and invoke
  	recv(..) only if the rule building state machiene is in the
  	idle state, as this is the only state in which an interaction
  	with the user is required. This should be more elegant
	cause no pause is needed to keep the cpu from going wild while
	nothing happens and the rule building fsm can run without delays.
