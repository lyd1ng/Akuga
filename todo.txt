100.	Expand User Class
101.	Propagate inter turn messages like 'summon_msg, move_msg'.
	This is used to render actions life.
200.	Add the possibility to enqueue post turn state changes.
  	Those could be used to implemenet mass displacements,
  	which isn`t possible, yet. Therefor it could be neccessary
	to add a TurnBegin and a TurnEnd State as a state change
	into the idle state should be possible without resetting the
	interferences and triggering the passive effects of jumons
	multiple times.
300.	Make the rule building state machine independent of the
  	current player, by adding a secret id to every player.
	The player has to send this id with every command as it will
	be used by the handle_client_connection function to enqueue
	the events for the rule building fsm with the right player.
	This way jumons can do moves in the name of opponent players
	as a part of their special effect.
400.	Use non blocking sockets within the match server and invoke
  	recv(..) only if the rule building state machiene is in the
  	idle state, as this is the only state in which an interaction
  	with the user is required. This should be more elegant
	cause no pause is needed to keep the cpu from going wild while
	nothing happens and the rule building fsm can run without delays.
401.	Add a timeout branch to the rule building fsm which is used to skip
	a turn if the player times out. This also kills the player if per
	has timeout out to often.
500.	Add a missed_turns counter to each player and kill the player if
	per has missed to much turns. A turn is missed if the recv() function
	times out.
600.	Add the possibility for the user to construct up to three jumon sets
	of jumons the user owns. That makes it neccessary to add a conto for
	every user and add the possibility to buy jumons, also the match
	functions needs the jumon sets as a parameter.
