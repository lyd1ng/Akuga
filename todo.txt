100.	Expand User Class
101.	Propagate inter turn messages like 'summon_msg, move_msg'.
	This is used to render actions life.
400.	Use non blocking sockets within the match server and invoke
  	recv(..) only if the rule building state machiene is in the
  	wait_for_user_state, as this is the only state in which an interaction
  	with the user is required. This should be more elegant
	cause no pause is needed to keep the cpu from going wild while
	nothing happens and the rule building fsm can run without delays.
401.	Add a timeout branch to the rule building fsm which is used to skip
	a turn if the player times out. This also kills the player if per
	has timeout out to often.
600.	Add the possibility for the user to construct up to three jumon sets
	of jumons the user owns. That makes it neccessary to add a conto for
	every user and add the possibility to buy jumons, also the match
	functions needs the jumon sets as a parameter.
